    "> In this exercise, we ask you to explore how an established labour market framework\n",
    "    can be used to start developing a map of jobs and skills. In this assignment you will\n",
    "    work with the [European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO)](https://ec.europa.eu/esco/portal)\n",
    "    framework. ESCO has been developed by the European Commission and includes\n",
    "    information on relationships between 2,942 occupations and 13,485\n",
    "    skills/competences.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Data**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">    The following datasets are provided:\n",
    " - **occupations_en.csv** contains information on 2,942 detailed occupations,\n",
    "including alternative occupation titles and occupation descriptions. Note that\n",
    "these occupations are aligned with a hierarchical occupational classification\n",
    "International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO). The ISCO system\n",
    "has four levels based on the number of digits in the code (with four digit\n",
    "codes being the most finely grained classification and first digit being the\n",
    "coarsest classification). The detailed occupations in the file represent a further\n",
    "more granular level of the classification. The field ‘iscoGroup’ refers to the\n",
    "code of the parent ISCO occupational group. The UK Standard Occupational\n",
    "Classification closely resembles ISCO and has a similar structure.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- **skills_en.csv** describes individual skills in the ESCO framework.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- **ESCO_occup_skills.json** is a dictionary, where the title of a detailed ESCO\n",
    "occupation serves as a key, and the description of this occupation is stored\n",
    "as a set of nested dictionaries. This file provides a link between occupations\n",
    "and skills that they require under label ‘_links’ and lists skills under further\n",
    "nested dictionaries (‘hasEssentialSkill’ for essential skill requirements and\n",
    "‘hasOptionalSkill’ for optional skills).\n",
    "So, to extract essential skills for an occupation with the official title Broadcast\n",
    "technician using Python from ESCO_occup_skills dictionary, you would use `\n",

    ">**Exercise**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Using this data we would like you to carry out one of the following tasks:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">    **a) Build an alternative occupation classification.** We are asking you to\n",
    "develop a data-driven categorisation of the 2,942 detailed occupations\n",
    "to construct an alternative to the existing ISCO hierarchy. One possible\n",
    "way to do that is to group occupations that have similar skill requirements.\n",
    "As an example, one branch of a hierarchical occupation classification\n",
    "could look like:\n",
    ">Health Professionals → Medical Practitioners → Doctor\n",
    "\n",
    ">    **b) Build a skills taxonomy.** The objective of this task is to identify meaningful\n",
    "groups of skills with a data driven approach. You might group skills that\n",
    "occur together frequently or in similar contexts, or that are similar in\n",
    "another way. As an example, one branch of a skills taxonomy could look\n",
    "like: Computer skills → Software development skills → Python\n",
    ">\n",
    ">There are different ways to approach these problems. For example, you might use\n",
    "tools from machine learning, natural language processing or network science.\n",
    "There is no ‘right answer’ or single approach for either task, and we acknowledge\n",
    "the limitations of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Approach in a Nutshell\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle **Task b) Build a skills taxonomy**, we start by **loading and inspecting the provided data** and its structure. We build several **helper functions, classes and dictionaries and graphs** for easier processing at later stages. We also **visualize the ISCO structure** and its associated occupations to gain a better understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the generated circular tree ISCO graph and the information about skills, occupations and ISCO ID, we develop a **measure for calculating the relevance of a skill** at any given node in the ISCO graph, by adapting the *tf-idf* measure. The *tf-idf* represents the relevance of a skill with regards to the skills frequency and distribution across the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *tf-idf* for skill at each node in the ISCO graph is used as a feature set. In order to fight the curse of dimensionality, we apply **dimensinality reduction using latent semantic analysis (LSA)**. We employ **k-means clustering** for finding groups of skills with similar features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for each skill in a cluster, we compute the two most similar skills by **computing the cosine similarity of the word embeddings** of their skill description. We **rank the skills by their *document frequency*** (collected at the feature engineering step), which allows the **creation of candidate branches in the taxonomy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Structure of this Jupyter Notebook<a id='top'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows a prototype for solving **Task b) Build a skills taxonomy**. It describes the entire process for developing this approach, including data analysis and some processing steps that are not necessary for the final pipeline. Some of the ideas and code blocks could also be utilize for solving Task a).\n",

We assume the following: if a skill is required for an occupation, then the skill is relevant for the occupation's ISCO ID - and to some extent also to the upper levels of this ISCO ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a specific skill A is required for an occupation with the ISCO ID `5123` but also for another occupation with the ISCO ID `5125`, then there are already two indicators for relevance of this skill at the ISCO node `512`. Very specific skills would only show high frequeuncy on the outer ISCO levels but not on the inner levels, while general skills are expected to be prevalent in the inner nodes as well. Specific skills would also appear more locally, while general skills are expected to be more distributed across the ISCO graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to **measure how specific or general a given skill is and how much it required for each ISCO node**. This task is similar to the task of determining the relevance of a word in a document, with regards to its use in the entire set of documents. This common NLP task is usually resolved with the statistical method [tf-idf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf). *tf* stands for **term frequency**, *idf* stands for **inversed document frequency**. The *tf* reprents the frequency of a the word in the given document, while the *df* represents in how many documents this word appears. Thus, the *inversed df* gives higher relevance to words that are not very general and only occur in few documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the *term frequency* represents the **frequency of a specific skill requirement at any ISCO node**. Using the example above, skill A is relevant for two occupations leading up to ISCO node `512`. The frequency is computed by counting the occurences (i.e. 2) and diving it by the highest possible count, i.e. the number of leaf nodes for ISCO node `512` (all downstream occupation nodes at the outermost level). The **term frequency measures how relevant a skill is at given ISCO node** in comparison to other skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *document frequency* represents here the **number of ISCO nodes that are affected by the skill requirement**. The additional association of skill A with ISCO ID `5123` affects the following nodes at different levels: `5123`, `512`, `51`, `5`. The association with `5125` adds only one new node to this set: `5125` itself. Thus, if skill A is spread more widely over the ISCO graph and is required for occupations with ISCO IDs of various top level categories, the document frequency will be higher than if the skill only affects occupations in the same part of the ISCO graph. Thus, the **document frequency computes how widely applicable or required a specific skill is across the ISCO graph**, with higher values indicating more general skills and lower values more specific skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the computation of the **tf-idf**, we use the *inversed document frequency* in order to give more weight to specific skills. If a skill is very general, it should not affect the ISCO node as much. Thus, the *tf-idf* in regards to the skill distribution over the ISCO graph measures **how relevant a skill is at a given ISCO node**."

    "In this notebook, we have described and implemented an approach for **generating a new taxonomy for skills**. We have loaded and analysed the data and even **fixed some errors** (3-digit ISCO IDs). We have visualized the data and the ISCO hierarchy. We have extracted *tf-idf* features for each skill and ISCO node and used those features for clustering the skills into reasonably meaningful groups of skills. Finally, extracted **taxonomy branches** including **skill synomyms** by utilizing word embeddings of skill descriptions and the document frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have found that many of the returned taxonomy branches are meaningful in the sense that they represent skills of the same field. Some even show **valuable hierachical structure**. However, many others are **not related in a hierarchical way**, even when sorted differently. Therefore, we must find an alternative way for **identifying related skill pairs of different taxonomy levels**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to solve this, we could use the ISCO levels and the term and document frequency for identifying skill pairs that occur in **similar contexts but are prevalent at different levels**. One could also try to measure **how much one skill covers another** (e.g. in terms of how many nodes or occupations) and use this informatiion for generating a hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also utilize the skill's *reuseLevel* categories (*sector-specific*, *cross-sector*, *occupation-specific* and *transversal*) as they may hold information about a skill's generality level and its position in the taxonomy. And we could pre-sort the skills into *skill/competence* and *knowledge* type, which could help building a more refined taxnomy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we could use **topic modeling** based on the skill descriptions (and/or the associated job descriptions) for **retrieving main and sub categories** for the taxonomy and grouping the skills.  Finally, we could try to employ **hierarchical clustering** for building the taxonomy based on the extracted features and the information we have on skills, occupations and ISCO IDs."
